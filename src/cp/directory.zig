//! V2 control plane — the tenant→cluster directory (v2-build-order
//! §Phase 3 "a minimal control plane — the tenant→cluster directory";
//! docs/v2-cp-directory-replication.md Slice 1).
//!
//! This is the routing source of truth: given a tenant's store id, which
//! cluster currently serves it. The **front-door** (`src/front/`)
//! reads it on every inbound request to pick a backend; the **move
//! orchestration** (Phase 4 / Phase 7) writes it — flipping a tenant's
//! placement is the atomic commit point of a tenant move.
//!
//! ## Two representations: the durable log + the in-memory projection
//!
//! Placement must survive a control-plane restart and (Slice 2) agree
//! across HA nodes, so the authoritative state lives in a **replicated
//! kvexp store** behind our own `bridge`/`Node` raft substrate — a single
//! "directory" raft group (gid = hash of `__directory__`). Each mutating
//! op (`addCluster` / `assign` / `move` / `beginMove` / `abortMove`)
//! encodes a writeset and **proposes it through the directory group,
//! awaiting commit** before it takes effect; the directory flip is
//! therefore one committed raft write.
//!
//! Reads, however, stay on a pointer-stable **in-memory projection** (the
//! `clusters` / `cluster_idx` / `placements` maps) — a materialized view
//! of the committed log. This keeps the front-door hot path zero-alloc and
//! lock-short (one hash lookup, return a `ClusterRef` by value whose slices
//! outlive the lock), and keeps request-path reads OFF the pump thread's
//! store entirely (the store is read only once, at boot, single-threaded,
//! to rebuild the projection). The projection is updated under the mutex by
//! the writer after its write commits.
//!
//! ## Boot / replay
//!
//! `initReplicated` registers the directory group, `ensureGroup`s it (which
//! reopens the persisted store + replays the WAL on a restart), then scans
//! `cluster/*` + `placement/*` to rebuild the projection. This MUST run
//! before `bridge.startPump()` — `ensureGroup` and the boot scan touch the
//! `Node` directly, which is only safe before the pump thread is live (the
//! bridge's load-bearing single-pump-thread invariant). After the pump is
//! started, a directory write goes through `propose` + watermark like any
//! tenant write. Static `REWIND_CLUSTERS` / `REWIND_PLACEMENT` seeding is
//! the front door's job, post-pump, and **only if the replayed store is
//! empty** (so a restart never re-seeds over a committed move).
//!
//! ## Ephemeral mode (tests)
//!
//! `init` (no bridge) keeps the pure in-memory behavior — the mutating ops
//! skip replication and just update the projection. The pure unit tests use
//! this; the durability test wires a real single-node bridge.
//!
//! ## Slice 1 scope / deferrals
//!
//!   - **Single-node CP only.** Writes assume this node leads the directory
//!     group (single-node always does). Slice 2 adds multi-node HA: a write
//!     on a follower faults → leader-aware retry; followers update their
//!     projection from the apply path, not just from local proposes.
//!   - **Host→tenant** is now a replicated axis here too (gap #2): the
//!     `hosts` projection + `host/{host}` keys, authored by the
//!     `/_control/host` write and seeded from `REWIND_HOSTS`. (It was a
//!     static front-door map in Slice 1.)
